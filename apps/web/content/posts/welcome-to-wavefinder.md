Wave Finder started as a small passion project to help local divers and spearos pick the right spot at the right time. This blog will share updates, ideas, trip notes, and lessons learned.

## What to expect

* Release notes and small fixes
* Spot deep‑dives with photos
* Community highlights

Thanks for being here!


# What is Wave Finder?

**Wave Finder** is an open‑source project (more on that in a later post) I started out of a love for spearfishing, diving, and our coastline. The goal is simple: help you choose *where* and *when* to dive, with information that’s practical and local.

## What’s live today

* **~100 Port Elizabeth dive locations** plotted on the map.
* Each spot includes: **type** (reef, wreck, blue water), **depth range**, **typical wildlife**, **difficulty**, and other useful notes.
* Designed to help **new divers** see good starter options and **progress** to more advanced sites over time.
* A **Weather Maps** tab with a **live wind overlay** you can toggle.

## What’s coming next

I’m training a **machine‑learning model** to predict underwater visibility for the bay. Here’s the approach:

1. **Collect conditions** - I log local weather/ocean patterns around Port Elizabeth.
2. **Measure reality** - On dives, I record actual visibility for the spot.
3. **Train the model** - Those measurements feed the model so it can learn which conditions lead to good or bad vis.

This takes time. Right now I’ve logged **~22 dives** for the bay; I need **about 200** quality logs before predictions become reliably accurate. As that dataset grows, I’ll roll out **historical trend views** and **forward‑looking visibility forecasts** in the app.

## How we can speed this up

**Community!** Local spearos often share vis reports on WhatsApp after a dive. With your permission, I can use those reports to help train the model. Every accurate “it was 4-5 m at X” type note makes the system smarter.

## Open source, community‑driven

Wave Finder is built in the open. If you want to help - whether it’s writing spot guides, testing features, or contributing code - you’re welcome. Check out my GitHub repositories, open an issue, or send a pull request. The more we build together, the better this becomes for everyone.

## Looking ahead

My hope is that Wave Finder becomes a handy tool for **Port Elizabeth spearos and divers** first, and then grows to **neighbouring cities** as the community and data expand.
